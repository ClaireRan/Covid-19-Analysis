# Covid-19-Analysis

## Introduction
This is the course project for DS5010 – Intro to Programming for Data Science, 2020 Fall in Northeastern University. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the whole world negatively. It has led to dramatic loss of people’s life over the world and disrupted people’s normal life. In this project, I focused on analyzing COVID-19 data to get a fundamental understanding of the situation worldwide and gain insights about the relationship between COVID-19 and climate. It contains a Python script which is implemented by some useful libraries, like pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, to do analysis.
